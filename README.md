# ctci-solutions

This repository contains the solutions for the ["Cracking the Coding Interview"](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0984782850/) classics by Gayle Laakmann McDowel by the members of my programming puzzle solving club. Unfortunately, we were unable to think of a non-cheesy name for it so far, but the desire to archive our solutions in a meaningful way prevailed, so there we go.

The solutions in question are results of a collaborative working process: we usually discuss the problem as a group, sketch possible alternative solutions while trying to analyse their pros and cons, write the chosen ones down on the whiteboard, and, finally, get to typing them into a computer to see if it all works.

The primary intent is thus to document our amazing achievements for our own purposes, so please do not open issues and/or submit pull requests to this repository **unless** you believe that our proposed solutions are *wrong*. We are not striving to build an ultimate collection of all solutions to CTCI in various languages. Instead, go ahead and post it as a gist, create your own solutions repository, or even consider contributing to the [Carreer Cup](https://www.careercup.com) website.
